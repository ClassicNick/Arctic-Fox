# Arctic Fox web Browser

This is a rebranded Pale Moon 27.9.4. It should be built with the 10.7 SDK to function properly on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
The goal here is to implement specific security updates and bug fixes to keep this snow leopard supported browser as up to date as possible.

It will also build for windows vista and up, and x86 and powerpc linux (more than likely any other unix/bsd varient as well).
